# CiteNexus Language-Port Specification v1 — Go & TypeScript

> One contract, three languages. Python is the **reference implementation**;
> ports conform to this contract, not to Python's source. Discipline borrowed
> from toolnexus: shared spec, per-language idiom, byte-identical behavior
> where behavior is observable.

## 0. The one invariant that makes ports cheap

**All state lives in S3 (or a filesystem) in language-neutral formats.**
Raw blobs are content-addressed bytes; manifests, graph, and wiki artifacts are
JSON; the vector index is **Lance format** (Arrow-based, readable natively from
Rust, Python, and TypeScript). There is no server, no wire protocol, no
process-local state.

Therefore the port contract is: **a corpus ingested by any implementation must
be retrievable and answerable by every other implementation, byte-for-byte.**
Python ingests → Go asks → TS evaluates, against the same bucket. Every rule in
this spec exists to protect that sentence.

## 1. Conformance tiers

Ports declare a tier; CI runs the shared conformance suite (§10) per tier.

| Tier | Capabilities | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| **T1 — Core** | client construct/from-config · `ingest` (text/bytes/path) · `retrieve` · `ask` (strict cite-or-abstain) · `evaluate(csv)` · Lance + Postgres backends · hooks · telemetry sink · streaming (post-verification chunking) · EN dual-query RRF | first release of any port |
| **T2 — Breadth** | extractors beyond txt/md/html (pdf/docx/pptx/csv) · chunker + contextualizer · graph/wiki/memory signals · web crawl · vision-into-evidence | parity release |
| **T3 — Later** | worker queue/DLQ · MCP · judge | optional |

A port MUST NOT ship an `ask()` without the faithfulness gate. A partial port
that answers without verifying is worse than no port — it carries the brand
without the guarantee.

## 2. Public API contract

Method names follow each language's idiom; **semantics and defaults are fixed**.

| Concept | Python (reference) | Go | TypeScript |
|---|---|---|---|
| Construct | `CiteNexus(base_uri, embedder=…, generator=…)` | `citenexus.New(baseURI, citenexus.WithEmbedder(…), …)` | `new CiteNexus(baseUri, { embedder, generator })` |
| From config | `CiteNexus.from_config(cfg)` | `citenexus.FromConfig(cfg)` | `CiteNexus.fromConfig(cfg)` |
| Ingest | `ingest(source, text=, document_id=, acl=)` | `Ingest(ctx, src, …opts)` | `await ingest(source, opts)` |
| Retrieve | `retrieve(q, k=, conversation_id=)` | `Retrieve(ctx, q, …)` | `await retrieve(q, opts)` |
| Ask | `ask(q, mode=, answer_language=, conversation_id=)` | `Ask(ctx, q, …)` | `await ask(q, opts)` |
| Stream | `stream(q, …)` → chunks | `Stream(ctx, q, …)` → channel | `stream(q)` → async iterable |
| Evaluate | `evaluate(csv_path)` | `Evaluate(ctx, path)` | `await evaluate(path)` |
| Crawl (T2) | `crawl(seed, max_pages=50, max_depth=3)` | `Crawl(ctx, seed, …)` | `await crawl(seed, opts)` |

Fixed defaults everywhere: `top_k=5`, strict trust mode, `memory_max_turns=20`,
`default_answer_language="en"`, partition `workspace=default`.

Go note: errors return `error`; a refusal is **not** an error — it is a valid
`Result` with `decision=refused`. TS note: everything IO-bearing is async.

## 3. Storage contract (the interop layer)

### 3.1 Layout — MUST be byte-identical

```
{base}/raw/{P}/{sha256-of-raw-bytes}            content-addressed raw blob
{base}/manifests/{P}/etag_manifest.json         idempotency (doc_id → checksum)
{base}/knowledge/{P}/structure/{doc_id}.json    structure index
{base}/knowledge/{P}/wiki/pages.json            wiki artifact (T2)
{base}/graph/{P}/graph.json                     graph artifact (T2)
{base}/vector/{P}/lancedb/                      Lance database (one per leaf)
```

- `{P}` = `level=value/level=value/…` joined with `/` (e.g. `org=acme/product=x`).
- Layer names are the closed set: `raw extracted knowledge graph vector manifests eval`.
- Checksums: **SHA-256 hex, lowercase** of the raw source bytes.
- Lance table name: `evidence_units`, one table per leaf database.

### 3.2 Row schema — MUST be identical

Every EU row (Lance column set == Postgres column set == dict keys):

```
eu_id: string    vector: float32[]   text: string      document_id: string
language: string page: int (−1 = none)  checksum: string  raw_uri: string
```

Search results add `_distance` (cosine); text-search results add `_text_score`.

### 3.3 The two store protocols

```
VectorStore:  upsert(rows) · search(vector, limit) -> rows+_distance · scan(limit?)
TextSearch:   search_text(query, limit) -> rows+_text_score        (optional)
```

Backend pairs (names are part of the contract):

| Backend | Vector | Text | Go binding | TS binding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lance** (default) | `LanceVectorStore` | `LanceTextSearch` (BM25-lite over scan) | **Rust FFI**: a thin C-ABI shim crate over the `lancedb` Rust crate, called via cgo (approved approach) | `@lancedb/lancedb` (official TS SDK) |
| **Postgres** | `PostgresVectorStore` (pgvector `<=>`) | `PostgresTextSearch` (native `tsvector`, **`'simple'` config** — no stemming) | `pgx` | `pg` |

Postgres semantics: one table per leaf, name = `{prefix}_{sanitized(P)}`
(lowercase, non-`[a-z0-9_]` → `_`); lazy connect; `SELECT` on a missing table
returns `[]` (parity with an empty Lance leaf); upsert = `INSERT … ON CONFLICT
(eu_id) DO UPDATE`.

### 3.4 The Rust core (`citenexus-core`) — Go's engine room

Since Go must link Rust for Lance anyway, the bridge is a single Rust crate
carrying everything Rust does better than the Go ecosystem, over one C ABI
with JSON in/out:

1. **store** — the Lance `VectorStore` calls: `upsert / search / scan / drop`.
2. **extract** — `extract(bytes, source_type) -> ExtractedDoc JSON` (blocks +
   images + structure) for pdf (`pdfium-render`), docx/pptx (OOXML-direct via
   `quick-xml` + zip), html (`scraper`/html5ever), md (`pulldown-cmark`).
3. **detect** — fastText **lid.176 via the pure-Rust `fasttext` crate** —
   the exact spec model, so detection is byte-identical with Python.

Nothing else crosses the boundary: retrieval logic, RRF, gates, chunking,
orchestration stay in Go. One bridge to maintain instead of five parser
dependencies, and extraction output is identical across Python and Go by
construction. TS MAY adopt the same crate via napi-rs in a later rev for
extraction parity; ports-v1 allows TS to use its native libs (conformance
fixtures are the arbiter either way).

## 4. Deterministic algorithm contract

These MUST produce identical outputs for identical inputs in all languages —
they are covered by shared fixtures (§10).

| Algorithm | Pinned definition |
|---|---|
| Tokenizer | lowercase, matches of `[a-z0-9]+` (ASCII only, no stemming) |
| Stopwords | the fixed 44-word English list in `conformance/stopwords.json` — used ONLY by relevance/faithfulness `content_tokens`, never by BM25 |
| BM25-lite | k1=1.5, b=0.75, idf = ln(1+(N−n+0.5)/(n+0.5)), rows with score 0 dropped, ties broken by input order |
| RRF | contribution `1/(k+rank+1)`, k=60, zero-based rank; fused payload = highest-scoring contributor (first wins ties); order by (−score, eu_id) |
| Dual-query | queries = [original, *reformulations]; every (retriever × query) list feeds ONE fusion; reranker scores the ORIGINAL query only |
| Relevance gate | `content_tokens(evidence_query) ∩ content_tokens(passage) ≠ ∅`; evidence_query = original + reformulations joined by space |
| Faithfulness gate | `tokens(answer) ⊆ tokens(passage)` and answer non-empty (ALL tokens, not content tokens) |
| Refusal | answer is exactly `I can't answer that from the available evidence.`; decision `refused`; empty claims/sources |
| Answer-language chain | reliable detection → explicit override → conversation language → dominant evidence language (stable tie: first seen) → default |
| eu_id formats | block `doc::{order}` · chunked child `doc::{order}::{i}` · vision `doc::img::{image_id}` |
| Chunker | recursive boundaries paragraph(`\n\s*\n`) → line(`\n`) → sentence(`(?<=[.!?])\s+`) → word; defaults max=450 "tokens" (whitespace words), overlap=60; greedy pack, overlap tail = trailing whole pieces within the budget |
| Contextual prefix | indexed `text` = `context + "\n" + chunk`; `citation.passage` = **verbatim chunk, always** |
| Hash fake embedding (tests) | dim 64; per token: `SHA-1(token)` hex as big int `% dim` → +1.0; L2-normalize (zero vector stays zero) |

## 5. Model-client contract

All model IO is injected endpoints; nothing bundled.

- **OpenAI-compatible**: embeddings `POST {base}/embeddings`; chat
  `POST {base}/chat/completions`; rerank `POST {base}/rerank` (Cohere/Jina
  `results[].{index, relevance_score}` shape).
- **Anthropic**: `POST {base}/v1/messages`, headers `x-api-key` +
  `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`, top-level `system`, required `max_tokens`
  (default 1024), reply = concatenated `content[].text` blocks.
- **Temperature is ALWAYS sent** (default 0.0) on every generation call.
- **Typed endpoint objects, app-resolved keys**: connections are declared as
  typed endpoints (OpenAI-style, Gemini, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Ollama, custom
  auth shapes) carrying base_url + key + headers + timeout + pre/post hooks.
  THE LIBRARY READS NO ENVIRONMENT — the application passes the key value,
  held in a redaction-safe wrapper (Python SecretStr; Go/TS equivalents must
  redact in String()/toString()/JSON). The endpoint type selects the wire
  protocol. Wire clients receive only base_url + model + transport.
- Every default HTTP transport sends `User-Agent: citenexus` (Cloudflare-fronted
  APIs 403 default library agents).
- Transports are injectable — unit tests are hermetic in all languages.
- The five prompts (grounded-answer system prompt with the verbatim-quote
  rule, vision JSON-description prompt, contextualizer prompt, EN-reformulation
  prompt, wiki-distillation prompt) are pinned **verbatim** in
  `conformance/prompts.json`; ports load or embed them unchanged.
- **Every model-backed capability ports the same way** — generator (OpenAI +
  Anthropic), reformulator, contextualizer, vision, and the wiki distiller are
  all plain HTTP + pinned prompt + JSON parse; none needs a language-specific
  SDK. Likewise Postgres is pinned SQL (§3.3), and the LLM wiki's artifacts
  (`pages.json` + Markdown tree) are language-neutral S3 objects — a wiki
  built by any implementation is navigable by every other (read-side is T1-
  adjacent even though distillation itself is T2).

## 6. Config contract

The §17 config is a language-neutral document (YAML/JSON), key-for-key the
Python schema: `storage` (bucket, partition_hierarchy, endpoint_url) · `llm`
(model, endpoint: typed-endpoint object, temperature=0, max_tokens) · `embedding` · `reranker` · `reformulation` · `vision` ·
`vector_store` (backend: `lancedb|postgres`, uri, table_prefix) · `retrieval`
(rrf_k=60, top_k) · `trust` · `multilingual` · `memory` · `signals`.
Unknown keys are an error (strict parsing) in every language.

## 7. Result contract

`Result` serializes to the same JSON in all languages (the conformance suite
compares serialized results): `answer`, `answer_language`, `mode`,
`evidence{decision, supporting_sources, distinct_documents,
retrieval_score_spread, all_claims_verified, languages_in_evidence}`,
`claims[]{claim, supported, sources[]}`, `sources[]{document, passage,
passage_language, page, bbox, source_uri}`, `provenance[]{claim, evidence_unit,
document_id, s3_object, checksum, page, produced_by}`, `missing_evidence[]`.
Citations are **verbatim source text** — never model output, never translated.

## 8. Hooks, telemetry, streaming

- **Hooks** (observe-only, never mutate, a raising hook is swallowed):
  `on_ingest(result)`, `on_retrieve(query, candidates)`, `on_answer(result)`,
  `on_refuse(result)`, `on_chunk(chunk)`. Go: a `Hooks` struct of funcs;
  TS: an object of optional functions.
- **Telemetry**: one event stream. `StageEvent{stage, partition, document_id?,
  duration_ms, tokens{input,output}?, units{images,pages,candidates}?, cost?,
  plugin?, outcome}`. Stage and Outcome enums are the closed Python sets.
  Minimum emission (T1): `fusion` (candidate count) + `generate` (real token
  usage + ok/refused) per `ask()`. Sink = anything with `emit(event)`.
- **Streaming**: chunks are released only AFTER verification. Strict mode:
  sentence-gated (`[^.!?]+[.!?]?` matches, trimmed, empty dropped); normal
  mode: word chunks with trailing space except the last. Never stream raw
  model tokens in strict mode — that would break the guarantee.

## 9. Language-specific implementation notes

### The shared Rust core — target architecture (DECIDED)

**One Rust library, FFI for all.** `citenexus-core` is the single engine for
every language — the pydantic-v2 / tokenizers / lancedb playbook:

```
                     citenexus-core (Rust)
   v1: store (lance) · extract (pdf/docx/pptx/html/md) · detect (lid.176)
   v2: + the pinned deterministic algorithms (§4): chunker · BM25 · RRF ·
        token gates — they are frozen contracts, so one implementation
        replaces cross-language conformance for them
             /                |                  \
        cgo C-ABI          napi-rs              pyo3
           Go             TypeScript            Python
      (required from     (native libs OK in   (adopts the core when the
       day one)           ports-v1; SHOULD      pyo3 binding lands —
                          migrate to core)      strangler-style, features
                                                never stall on the rewrite;
                                                Python stays the BEHAVIOR
                                                reference throughout)
```

**The core is the engine, not the brain.** Orchestration NEVER moves in:
the ask flow, cite-or-abstain, plugin seams, hooks, config, and all model
HTTP calls stay in each host language (IO-bound — no Rust win, and the
guarantee logic must stay hackable without a Rust toolchain). Boundary rule:
JSON (Arrow allowed for row batches) in/out, **no callbacks across FFI**.
Wherever the core has a capability, a binding uses it; native libraries
remain only where the core lacks coverage or a platform cannot link it.

### Go
- Module `github.com/muthuishere/citenexus-go`. Layout mirrors capability
  packages (`storage`, `retrieve`, `answer`, `ingest`, …).
- Lance + extraction + detection via `citenexus-core` (cgo); prebuilt static
  libs per platform in releases. Everything else pure Go (pgx, net/http).
- Concurrency: `context.Context` on every IO call; per-retriever fan-out with
  an errgroup is allowed — ORDER of fused output must stay deterministic.
- No reflection-based config: decode into typed structs, reject unknown keys.

### TypeScript
- Package `citenexus` (npm) or `@citenexus/core`. ESM, Node ≥ 20; types shipped.
- `@lancedb/lancedb` for the Lance pair; `pg` for Postgres; `fetch` transport.
- Extraction: native libs allowed in ports-v1 (pdfjs-dist, OOXML-direct); the
  napi binding of `citenexus-core` is the parity path and SHOULD replace them
  once published.
- All model/transport seams are injectable functions — same hermetic-test rule.
- The whole public surface is `async`; `stream()` returns an async iterable.

## 10. Conformance suite (the real contract)

A `conformance/` directory in this repo, versioned with the spec:

- `stopwords.json`, `prompts.json` — pinned data (§4, §5).
- `cases/tokenize.json` — text → tokens.
- `cases/bm25.json` — rows+query → ordered (eu_id, score rounded 1e-6).
- `cases/rrf.json` — ranked lists → fused order.
- `cases/faithful.json` — (answer, passage) → supported bool.
- `cases/chunker.json` — text+params → chunks.
- `cases/eu_ids.json` — doc blocks → eu_id list + checksum.
- `cases/language.json` — fallback-chain inputs → answer language.
- `cases/result_roundtrip.json` — Result JSON canonical serialization.
- `cases/e2e_hermetic.json` — corpus + questions → decision/source/passage,
  run with the hash fake embedding + extractive fake LLM (both pinned in §4),
  so every language proves cite-or-abstain end-to-end offline.
- `cases/vision_orchestration.json` — the two-phase vision seam (ADR-0005, §9):
  the ordered `emit` list of `PendingVisionRequest`s (byte-identical data-URI +
  prompt + `source_ref`), the `fulfilled` records, the `assembled` figure EUs,
  and a `degrade` join where an unfulfilled request yields no EU. The two `images`
  carry PNG vs JPEG magic bytes: the emitted `payload.image_url` declares each
  image's **true** media type (sniffed from the magic bytes — png/jpeg/gif/webp,
  else png), so a port MUST sniff the format, not hardcode `image/png`.

**The vision FFI seam.** Vision is host-fulfilled: the core exposes two bound
entry points across the FFI — **emit** (parse an artifact → the `emit` list) and
**assemble** (`{request_id: description}` → figure EUs). Between them each port
implements a thin, in-language **fulfiller**: "POST this payload → return the
description string." The API key lives only in that fulfiller's transport and
never crosses into the core. Ports reproduce `emit` and `assembled` from the
fixture byte-for-byte; only the raw model call in the middle differs per
language. Degrade-to-text is part of the contract: a request the host leaves
unfulfilled (or fails) yields no figure EU and never fails ingest.

**Interop test (CI, opt-in like MinIO):** Python ingests the example corpus
into MinIO → the port under test runs `ask()` against that bucket → answers
must match the hermetic expectations. This is the sentence in §0, executed.

## 11. Versioning

- This spec: `ports-v1`, tracking Python `0.2.x` behavior. A Python change that
  alters any pinned constant/prompt/format bumps `ports-vN` and the fixtures.
- Each port publishes independently but declares `Conformance: ports-v1 (T1)`
  in its README and CI badge.

## 12. Non-goals for ports

- No LangChain/LlamaIndex interop layers. No bundled models. No new backends
  inside a port that Python lacks (propose here first — contract before code).
- No "lenient mode" that skips verification. The guarantee is the product.
